    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Like any braise, this braised red potato recipe starts on the stove top and finishes up in the oven. It yields tender, flavorful potatoes your family will love. Ham, meatloaf, or roast chicken will shine beside this potato side dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 to 2 pounds small red potatoes, cut into 1-inch-thick slices</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh herbs, such as parsley, rosemary, or sage</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth or stock</li>
        <li>2 sprigs rosemary, or herbs of choice (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat butter and olive oil together in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>When the butter is melted, swirl the skillet to mix butter and oil. Add sliced onions and cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add potatoes and herbs. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes begin to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in garlic and heat until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Turn off the burner and stir in chicken broth or stock. Cover.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are fork tender, about 10 minutes. Remove the lid; continue to bake until most of liquid is evaporated, about 20 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh herb sprigs, if desired, and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
